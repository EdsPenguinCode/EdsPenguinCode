- Hi,
- I’m interested in learning how work in IT, anything Linux related too.
- I’m currently going to school for IT it's a program called YearUp.
- I’m looking to collaborate on Free and Open Source Projects to help me get more familiar with Linux or just programming in general.
-
- This is a script I made to see if I could install Arch Linux easier and faster.
-
- Let me know if I can improve it in any way.
-
- I am a complete beginner at this by the way.
